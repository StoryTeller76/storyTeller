    <title>Importance of youth programs</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Why are youth programs important</h1>
    <p>Youth programs offer huge benefits to tweens and teens. Researchers refers the Six C's - desired outcome that many youth programs provide to young people:
        <ol>
            <li>Competence in academic, social and vocational areas.</li>
            <li>confidence or a positive self-identity</li>
            <li>connections to community, family and and peers</li>
            <li>character or positive value ,intgrity and moral commitment</li>
            <li>Caring and compassion</li>
            <li>contribution</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>As children grow to middle to high school age they seek more autonomy and independence. They naturally react against authority and the kinds of structure found in programs for younger children. Not surprisingly, these youth program qualities benefit teens developmentally.

Youth programs are important because they can help build these Six Câ€™s, preparing adolescents for a variety of roles they assume as they reach college-age and the workforce.</p>
